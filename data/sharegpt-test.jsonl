{"id":"N73z5gb_0","instruction":"Make this abstract 150 words or less: Patient-doctor communication is a critical element of healthcare interactions that can have a direct impact on the occurrence of medical errors, as well as treatment decisions and outcomes. Common barriers to patient-doctor communication include patients\u2019 feeling unable to share information, cognitive impairment in patients, and the dominating nature of the biomedical culture in healthcare. The emergence of new healthcare technologies presents an opportunity to improve healthcare communication through both new tools and shifts in practices. Combined with patient-centered care models of communication, user experience design and operational implementations can be leveraged to improve the quality of the relationship between patient and medical provider, information exchange in the dyad, and shared decision-making. The present research adopts a person-centered care model of communication approach to propose design and operational implementations of eHealth technology to improve patient-doctor interactions, resulting in higher quality healthcare and a reduction in negative health outcomes. Specifically, we propose ways in which eHealth can be used for rapport building, improved information exchange, and higher quality shared decision-making between patients and doctors."}

We use reinforcement learning from human feedback to train our models with two new additions to help human raters judge agent behaviour. First, to make our agent more helpful and harmless, we break down the requirements for good dialogue into natural language rules the agent should follow, and ask raters about each rule separately. We demonstrate that this breakdown enables us to collect more targeted human judgements of agent behaviour and allows for more efficient rule-conditional reward models.

This way people can do this in publishable of non-publishable libraries.\n\nHow could I tell this user that we don't want to add this capability into Nx, that it is essentially a typescript issue rather than something we should take care of politely?"}
